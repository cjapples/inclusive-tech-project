## Group members
Elizabeth Crowdus, Luke Giacalone, Lilly Hackworth, Jillian Ritchey

## Topic
### User Group
Students at the University of Chicago with dietary restrictions and allergies.
### Goal
Implement a way for this user group to more easily navigate the dining halls. We want to make it easy for users to identify which dishes they can eat, and which they should avoid. 


##### Project Name/Slogan Ideas: "Allergies will be Nacho Problem anymore", "Does it pasta test?"
